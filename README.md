#Topic 1: VARIABLES & DATA TYPES QUESTIONS

 Question 1 : In a program, input 3 numbers: A, B andC. Youhave to output the average of
 these 3 numbers.
 (Hint : Average of N numbers is sum of those numbers divided by N)

 solution :
 

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int A = sc.nextInt();
        int B = sc.nextInt();
        int C = sc.nextInt();

        int Average = (A + B + C)/3 ;
        System.out.println("Average is : " + Average);
    }

 Question 2: In a program, input the side of a square. You have to output the area of the
 square.
 (Hint : area of a square is (side x side))


 solution:


    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int Side = sc.nextInt();

        int AreaOfSquare = Side * Side ;
        System.out.println("Area of Square is :" + AreaOfSquare);
    }


 Question 3: Enter cost of 3 items from the user (using float data type)- a pencil, a pen and
 an eraser. You have to output the total cost of the items back to the user as their bill.
 (Add on : You can also try adding 18% gst tax to the items in the bill as an advanced problem)

 solution:


    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        float Pencil = sc.nextFloat();
        float Pen = sc.nextFloat();
        float Eraser = sc.nextFloat();

        float total = (Pencil + Pen + Eraser);
        System.out.println("Toatal of 3 items are :" + total);

        float FinalToatl = total + (0.18f * total);
        System.out.println("Final cost of 3 product including gst is :" + FinalToatl);

    }
